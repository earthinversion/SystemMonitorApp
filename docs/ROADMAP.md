# Roadmap

I use this roadmap to keep the project moving from demo quality to portfolio quality.

## Near-term
- Add per-core CPU visualization
- Add top-process table with CPU/RAM sort
- Add threshold alerts with color states

## Mid-term
- Add metric persistence with SQLite
- Add export presets (CSV, JSON)
- Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility pass

## Long-term
- Add plugin providers for GPU, temperature, and battery
- Add remote agent mode to monitor multiple machines
- Add CI release pipeline for Windows/macOS/Linux builds
