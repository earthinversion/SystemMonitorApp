# Feature Proposals

I grouped future features by recruiter impact and implementation effort so I can prioritize visibly strong wins.

## High Impact, Low Effort
- Add configurable alert thresholds for CPU, RAM, and disk.
- Show top 5 active processes in a compact table.
- Add a session summary panel (peak CPU, peak RAM, average throughput).

## High Impact, Medium Effort
- Add theme presets (Classic, Light, Neon) and save preference.
- Add export actions from UI (CSV + JSON).
- Add tray mode with notifications when thresholds are breached.

## High Impact, High Effort
- Add multi-host monitoring with a lightweight agent.
- Add historical trend views backed by SQLite.
- Add anomaly detection with rolling z-score rules.
